# Project 1: Shell

This project was created for the CS3650 class as the first major project. Our goal was to create a UNIX shell implementing the same functionality as it. 


The [Makefile](Makefile) contains the following targets:

- `make all` - compile everything
- `make tokenize` - compile the tokenizer demo
- `make shell` - compile the shell
- `make shell-tests` - run a few tests against the shell
- `make test` - compile and run all the tests
- `make clean` - perform a minimal clean-up of the source tree
